Silent auction is a fundraising event or activity commonly used by nonprofit organizations, charities, schools, and other groups to raise money for a specific cause. In a silent auction, participants place bids on various items or services by writing down their bid amount on a sheet of paper or a bid card, typically placed next to each item.

This code intends to automate it instead of using a bid card or a sheet of paper, you place your bid silently into the  system and the system automatically pick the highest bidder.
